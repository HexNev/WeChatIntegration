WeChatIntegration
=================

WeChat Integration POC.

The documentation out there is pretty bad and mostly in Chinese. 
Most of the problems you will face have not to do with the code but with your app registration. 
The problem I have seen the most is people registering thir app on the english site (http://dev.wechat.com/). This will not work
asi the site seems unattendent so you will never be approved and thus the SDK will not work with an unregistered app.

Instead try registering on the Chinese site (http://weixin.qq.com/), Google Translate is your friend
